            <strong>Panoptic</strong> is an open-source website metrics tracking and visualization application, made with developers in mind to create a <em>seamless</em> development experience while <em>optimizing</em> your website.
          </p>

          <Heading size='lg'>Why use Panoptic?</Heading>
          <br />
          <p>
            During development, it can be difficult to keep track of the performance of your application. There could be some change that is made which happens to degrade the user experience in some way. This is even harder to track when the losses are minute, or are related to something that is hidden unless you are expressely looking for it (i.e. accessibility). Using <strong>Panoptic</strong> you are able to track the metrics of your application, including:<strong> Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO</strong>, over a long period of time, to catch exactly <em>where</em> and <em>why</em> a regression occurred. 
            <br />
            <br />
            With GitHub integration we are able to automatically run a test daily if there has been a commit to an endpoints associated repository, making it simple and effective to visit our application at any point in your development process.

            If you would like to test the application prior to signing up, please utilize our <a className={styles.docsLink} href='./demo' target='_blank'>Demo Page</a>. From there you can run a test on any endpoint with our application. This data is not saved but a new test can be run at any time.

            <br />
            <br />
            Log in to the application by making an account with us or sign up with your GitHub account.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you choose to log in with GitHub, then you will have access to organizing your testable endpoints within a list of your existing GitHub Repositories.

            After logging in to the application you will be greeted by our dashboard. On the left side you will see our enpoint selector, which if logged in with GitHub will also include all of your repositories. Here you can add endpoints to, or delete them from your repositories. Be careful when deleting endpoints as this will also delete all associated saved data on them.
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />
            In the center of the page we have our graphing tools, upon first load it will always show the most recent test ran on the first endpoint of your first listed repository.

            <br />
            On the right side of the page is our in depth metrics. These are the same that you would find on the demo page, the include an in depth look at your webpage and a breakdown of what is going well vs what can be improved upon. If you expand them you will find a brief discription about them and a link to the associated Lighthouse documentation for more information.
