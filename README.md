# Panoptic

An open-source tool for tacking website performance. 

Panoptic is used to track key metrics for your website during development and deployment including **Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO**

By tracking these key metrics over a long period of time, Engineers are able to spot a regression in performance to identify why and when a regression has occurred

Panoptic is powered by Google's Lighthouse SDK, and keeps track of data from all past reports to create a long term image of the health of your application

## Try Panoptic

To get started, open [www.panoptic.app](http://www.panoptic.app)

Navigate to our sign-up/login page

Create an account manually, or sign in with your existing github account

If you sign in with your github account then you will see a list of your existing repositories, otherwise all endpoints to be tested will be added to "other"

Select that endpoint and click "run test" 

After waiting for the test to complete, you may need to reload the page (Adding this to the graph on LH audit completion is a feature we are looking to add in the near future) 

Select the associated endpoint again and you will see your test has been added to the line graph

Run this test any time there is a change to your main branch to keep a long term picture of the health of your application

In the future we plan to add GitHub action integration to allow these tests to run automatically through your repository's CI/CD pipeline
